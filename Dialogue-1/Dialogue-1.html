<body>		<div class="Dialogue">MRS. BLAISE:
                    Well, then.  Oh, yes.  I guess that 
                    does it for our analysis of The Old Man 
                    and the Sea.  Any other comments? Kat? <br><br>
          
                                 KAT:
                    Why didn't we just read the Hardy Boys?<br><br>
          
                                MRS. BLAISE:
                    I'm sorry?<br><br>
          
                                 KAT:
                    This book is about a guy and his 
                    fishing habit.  Not exactly a crucial 
                    topic.
                    Frankly, I'm baffled as to why we still 
                    revere Hemingway.  He was an abusive, 
                    alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of 
                    cats.<br><br>
          
                                 JOEY:
                    As opposed to a bitter self-righteous 
                    hag who has no friends?<br><br>
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE:
                    That's enough, Mr. Dorsey.<br><br>

                    KAT:
                    I guess the school board thinks because 
                    Hemingway's male and an asshole, he's 
                    worthy of our time. What about Colette?  Charlotte Bronte? Simone de Beauvoir?<br><br><br><br><br><br>

                    MRS. BLAISE:
                          
                    I'd like you all to write your own 
                    version of Shakespeare's Sonnet #141.
                    Any form you'd like.  Rhyme, no rhyme, 
                    whatever.  I'd like to see you elaborate 
                    on his theme, however. Let's read it 
                    aloud, shall we? Anyone? 

                    Derek?<br><br>
          
                                 DEREK:
                    In faith, I do not love thee with mine 
                    eyes/ For they in thee a thousand errors 
                    note/ But 'tis my heart that loves what 
                    they despise/ Who in despite of view is 
                    pleas 'd to dote.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
          
         
					

				MRS. BLAISE:
                          
                    Would anyone care to read theirs aloud?<br><br>
        
          
                                 KAT:
                    I'11 go<br><br>
          

          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                    Oh, Lord. Please Proceed.<br><br>

		I hate the way you talk to me<br>
		and the way you cut your hair<br>
		I hate the way you drive my car<br>
		I hate it when you stare.<br><br>

		I hate your big dumb combat boots<br>
		and the way you read my mind<br>
		I hate you so much it makes me sick<br>
		it even makes me rhyme.<br><br>

		I hate the way you’re always right<br>
		I hate it when you lie<br>
		I hate it when you make me laugh<br>
		even worse when you make me cry<br>
		I hate it that you’re not around<br>
		and the fact that you didn’t call<br>
		But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you<br><br>
		not even close, not even a little bit, not even any at all.</p>
